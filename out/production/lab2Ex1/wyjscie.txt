If You : 
 
 
 
I want know 
 
one thing. 
 
 
 
You know is: 
 
if I 
 
at the at 
 
of the at 
 
if I 
 
near the 
 
the impalpable 
 
or the of 
 
everything carries you, 
 
as if exists, 
 
aromas, light, 
 
were little 
 
that sail 
 
toward those yours 
 
 
 
Well, now, 
 
if little you 
 
I shall you 
 
 
 
If suddenly 
 
you forget 
 
do not me, 
 
for I have 
 
 
 
If you long 
 
the wind 
 
that passes life, 
 
and you 
 
to leave the 
 
of the I 
 
remember 
 
that on 
 
at that 
 
I shall arms 
 
and my set 
 
to seek 
 
 
 
But 
 
if each 
 
each hour, 
 
you feel are 
 
with implacable 
 
if each flower 
 
climbs up lips 
 
ah my my 
 
in me fire 
 
in me extinguished 
 
my love your 
 
and as you 
 
without leaving
